
Compiling
---------

The program currently only runs on windows.

To compile you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install Visual Studio 2008 
   (If installing Express edition you might need to get the platform SDK)

2. Download Qt 4.3+ @ http://trolltech.com/downloads/opensource

3. Unpack Qt in a dir of your chosing for example: 
   c:\qt-win-opensource-src-4.3.3
   
4. Set the environment variable QTDIR to point to this directory in windows:
   
   a. Right click My Computer -> Properties
   b. Advanced tab -> Environment variables
   c. Under "System variables" click "New"
   d. Variable name: QTDIR
   e. Variable value: c:\qt-win-opensource-src-4.3.3
   f. Also add C:\qt-win-opensource-src-4.3.3\bin to your PATH-variable
      (this is so that the QT dll's will be found by your program when running it without having
      to copy them to your build directory. Note that you'll need to restart Visual Studio after adding this).
   
5. a. Start -> Programs -> Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 -> Visual Studio Tools -> Visual Studio 2008 Command prompt
   b. cd %QTDIR%
   c. configure (answer the questions)
   d. nmake
   e. Wait for Qt to finish building (this can take a LONG time, ~1 hour) :)
   
6. Open the "Picknplace.sln" solution file in Visual Studio 2008 and build.
   (Note! The camera widget is always built in "Release"-mode! This is so that
   it can be used in the "QT Designer", since any plugins for it has to be
   built as Release if the Designer was built for that. This means that you should
   first build the solution in Release mode, before you can build any of the projects
   in Debug mode).
