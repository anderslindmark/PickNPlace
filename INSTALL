
Compiling
---------

The program currently only runs on windows.

To compile you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install Visual Studio 2008 
   (If installing Express edition you might need to get the platform SDK)

2. Download Qt 4.3+ @ http://trolltech.com/downloads/opensource

3. Unpack Qt in a dir of your chosing for example: 
   c:\qt-win-opensource-src-4.3.3
   
4. Set the environment variable QTDIR to point to this directory in windows:
   
   a. Right click My Computer -> Properties
   b. Advanced tab -> Environment variables
   c. Under "System variables" click "New"
   d. Variable name: QTDIR
   e. Variable value: c:\qt-win-opensource-src-4.3.3
   f. Also add C:\qt-win-opensource-src-4.3.3\bin to the end of your PATH-variable
      (this is so that the QT dll's will be found by your program when running it without having
      to copy them to your build directory).
   
5. a. Start -> Programs -> Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 -> Visual Studio Tools -> Visual Studio 2008 Command prompt
   b. cd %QTDIR%
   c. configure
   d. nmake
   e. Wait for Qt to finish building :)
   
6. Open the "Picknplace.sln" solution file in Visual Studio 2008 and build.
